        or M-cells. These spikes are much larger and usually above 7.5 microVolts in amplitude. They spike amplitude is also dependent
        on the distance between electrodes and fish and the orientatio of the fish. Therefore we categorise Mauthner spikes not by
        a fixed threshold nut by anamplitude that is at least four times higher than the median amplitude. This function subdivides

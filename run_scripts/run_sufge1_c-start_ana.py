Fish Behavior Analysis Script

This script is designed for analyzing fish behavior, particularly focusing on Danio rerio (zebrafish). 
It encompasses functionalities for data collection, processing, filtering, statistical analysis, and visualization. 
The script is structured into several functions that together facilitate a complete analysis workflow.

Key Functionalities:
1. Data Collection: The script collects data from a fish database and external CSV files, 
   organizing it by fish genotype, sex, and various metrics such as spike frequency, speed, 
   tortuosity, and Mauthner spike histogram.

2. Data Processing: It includes functions for applying Butterworth and Gaussian low-pass filters 
   to the data, useful for reducing high-frequency noise and smoothing the data for better analysis.

3. Statistical Analysis: Functions are provided to calculate mean, median, standard error of the mean (SEM), 
   and confidence intervals for various metrics, enabling detailed statistical insights into the fish behavior.

4. Data Visualization: The script contains functions for plotting the processed data in various formats, 
   including line plots with shaded confidence intervals and bar graphs for Mauthner cell activity.

5. Data Saving and Loading: It includes functionalities to save processed data to disk for persistence 
   and to load pre-existing processed data, enhancing efficiency by avoiding redundant data processing.

6. Main Workflow: The 'main' function orchestrates the entire workflow, checking for pre-existing processed data, 
   collecting and processing new data if necessary, applying statistical replacements, and plotting the final results.

Usage:
The script is executed by running the 'main' function. Users can customize the file paths for data input and output,
as well as modify parameters for data processing and visualization according to their specific requirements.

Dependencies:
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- SciPy for statistical functions and filters

Note:
This script assumes the presence of a fish database and relies on specific CSV file structures and formats.
Users should ensure that the required data is properly formatted and accessible to the script.
